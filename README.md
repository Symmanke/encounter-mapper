# **Encounter Mapper**
### Created by Eric Symmank

Encounter Mapper is a toolset used for developing tile-based
grid maps for role-playing games such as D&D, etc. The
program allows for the creation of individual tiles that
can be arranged on a grid or map. Also allows for users to place down notes, which can be used to notate details about the particular encounter.

Encounter Builder is developed in Python 3 using PyQT.

## **Current Features:**
- Tile-based map editor
- Editor for individual tiles as well as tile groups
- Palette editor for the tile Foreground and Background
- Notes Editor to provide additional details regarding the encounter.
- Ability to save and load encounters

## **Future Plans:**
- Ability to export images of the encounter grid.
- Ability to export the encounter grid and notes into a document via LaTex
- Selection of objects, as well as copy/paste functionality
- **Object Editor:** add basic objects to the grid for more decoration (chairs, etc.)
- **History Stack:** allow for undo/redo actions
- Replace placeholder graphics with custom images
- More keybindings
- More professional tiles from given data, including:
    - background/foreground textures
    - shading/lighting effects
- **Refactor of the Palette Editor** for cleaner color pickers
- better error handling and more clear documentation
